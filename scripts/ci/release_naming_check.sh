# Spec 048 FR-016..FR-018 (#1574): static guard for the GitHub Release naming
# convention, run by scripts/ci/repository_checks.sh on every PR.
#
# 1. Artifact releases created by workflows (`gh release create` in
#    .github/workflows) MUST pass `--latest=false` and MUST NOT use the
#    product title `Traverse v...`.
# 2. The product release is created only by scripts/ci/create_product_release.sh,
#    wired into ci.yml after the crates.io `publish` job.
# 3. docs/releases/v<workspace version>.md MUST exist, so the product release
#    always has its notes when the version is bumped.
